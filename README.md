# Lab-10
The "Ontario Public Library Statistics Dataset" is chosen as the dataset to be used for analysis and machine learning activities for this dataset assignment. With an emphasis on understanding library services, relationships, and their impact on the communities they serve, the selection of these datasets was justified by the need to study and evaluate data pertaining to public libraries in Ontario, Canada. Both datasets have the potential for numerous analysis tasks, such as classification, regression, and clustering, to shed light on library services and collaborations.

Dataset 1: Ontario Public Library Statistics Dataset
An extensive amount of data about public libraries in Ontario can be found in this dataset, including information on their services, locations, people served, and demographics. Investigating connections between the traits of libraries and the populations they serve is made possible. The dataset is appropriate for machine learning applications such as forecasting library utilization based on demographic variables, categorizing library kinds, or examining the effect of library services on community involvement. 

Instructions for Running the Code

 1. Make sure you have installed Python and the required libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn) on your machine or Jupyter Notebook environment.

2. Data Loading: Ensure that you have the respective datasets in a format that can be read by Pandas (e.g., CSV, Excel). Use pd.read_csv() or similar functions to load the data into Pandas DataFrames.

3. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data as required for your analysis. This includes handling missing values, converting data types, and splitting the data into features and target variables.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to gain insights into the data distribution, correlations, and relationships between features. Use Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

5. Machine Learning Tasks: Depending on your objectives, apply machine learning models such as SVM, Random Forest, or other algorithms. Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split(), train the models, and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

6. Interpretation and Analysis: Analyze the results of the machine learning models to draw meaningful conclusions about the datasets' characteristics, patterns, and potential impacts.
